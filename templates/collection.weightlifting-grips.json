            "text": "<p>Weightlifting grips are an accessory that is a version of lifting straps, which is used to promote grip strength and control during lifting weights. These are small gloves or straps you wear to improve your grip and prevent slipping the weights.<\/p><p>Usually, they are made of durable materials that bring comfort and grip security when your hands are sweaty or tired. They expose the fingers for a better grip and natural feel. Usually, lifting grips consist of two key elements: a wrap that keeps your wrist in place and a padded strap that protects your skin and ensures a secure grip throughout the whole training.<\/p><p>Most lifting grips are made of leather or neoprene providing good cushioning and helping prevent slippage. <\/p><p>Weightlifting grips are useful specifically for cross-trainers as they allow athletes to focus on their form and performance lifting heavier weights. This tool can also help to prevent blisters and calluses.<\/p><p>Grips can be also called cross-training hand grips as they're used by cross-training athletes during WODs. Although, today grips are becoming popular due to their support while lifting.<\/p>",

The padded section should be against your palm, and the strap should wrap around your wrist well.<\/p><p>Adjust the fit and grip to make them moderately snug for better support. Place your hands around the bar to check whether the grips improve the contact between your hands and the bar itself for better hold.<\/p><p>When lifting and pulling, you'd better curve the grip portion into your palm as it wraps around the bar. This way you'll be able to release the bar quickly when you’re finished.<\/p><p>For pushing exercises, the grip pad should lay snugly against your palm for hand-enhanced support and protection.<\/p>",
